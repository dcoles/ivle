# Installation Procedure for IVLE
# ===============================

# Target Machine: Ubuntu (Versions 6.06 and 7.10 - differences between
# versions noted)
#
# IMPORTANT: This is NOT a shell script. It has interactive sections and
# things that need to be customized.
# It is written like a shell script so it can be mostly cut-and-pasted into
# the shell, but it can't simply be executed.

# While other install guides in this package are generic, this one is very
# specific to our intended configuration. It will be very helpful if trying to
# set up IVLE on Ubuntu 7.06 or higher; less helpful for other platforms.
# This refers to ivle.conf, also included.

sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list

# 7.10 (Gutsy) specific #

# Gutsy by default had the CD-ROM packages selected, and the Internet packages
# commented out. (A comment in the apt sources list said it was because it
# failed to verify - IMPORTANT?? Probably not.)
# Comment out line 4 (deb cdrom:...)

# End 7.10 (Gutsy) specific #

# Uncomment ALL the lines for main, restricted and universe
# (deb http:...gutsy main restricted, deb-src ... main restricted
# deb http:...gutsy universe)
# Universe is important for pysvn (python-svn) later on

# Installing ivle
# ===============================
# Check out the IVLE trunk
export IVLE_SVN=ivle_svn
svn co https://ivle.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ivle/trunk $IVLE_SVN

cd $IVLE_SVN

# Says the SourceForge certificate authority is not trusted.
# I chose "Accept (p)ermanently" - Problem??

# Create a postgres database
sudo -u postgres dropdb ivle  # if it was previously created and now changed
sudo -u postgres createdb ivle
sudo -u postgres psql -d ivle < userdb/users.sql

# NOTE: From this point onwards it is 7.10 (Gutsy) specific. This is because I
# never was able to get IVLE to build with all dependencies on Dapper.

# Set up IVLE
./setup.py listmake
./setup.py config

# "Root directory" - type "/"
# "UID of web server process" - 1000 at this stage (informatics)
# Leave others default.
# Note: This will cause IVLE to get installed to /opt/ivle

./setup.py build
sudo ./setup.py install

# Create a user
sudo ./makeuser.py [OPTIONS] <login> 'Firstname Lastname' <rolenm> -p <password>
# role = guest/student/tutor/lecturer/admin

# Configure the Apache HTTP server
sudo cp setup/ivle.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available
# MODIFY the first few lines so it is specific to your server.
vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/ivle.conf

# Replace the existing config link with the ivle one
cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -fs /etc/apache2/sites-available/ivle.conf 000-default

# Make the directory corresponding to the directory for saved session
# objects in the apache config ivle.conf. Make sure it is owned by www-data,
# or at least readable and writable by it.

sudo mkdir /home/informatics/sessions
sudo chown www-data:www-data /home/informatics/sessions

# Restart the server
sudo apache2ctl -k restart


#
# Installing Pound reverse proxy (optional)
sudo apt-get install pound

# edit /etc/default/pound so that the line reading
#     startup=0
# instead reads
#     startup=1
#
# copy pound.cfg to /etc/pound/pound.cfg
# edit IP addresses in pound.cfg
