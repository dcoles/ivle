Install Procedure - Frequently Asked Questions
==============================================

This is a guide for administrators trying to configure IVLE. It answers
questions about common installation mistakes.

Two IVLE headings, and 404 error message "There is no application called 'php'.
===============================================================================

This is an Apache conf problem - you are missing the following section:

    <Directory "/usr/local/share/ivle/www/php">
        SetHandler None
    </Directory>

The easiest way is to ensure you copied ivle.conf.

IVLE displays a generic Terms of Service notice
===============================================

You should customize the TOS notice at /var/lib/ivle/notices/tos.html.

Apache Server isn't Restarting
==============================

Make sure no console processes are lying around (e.g. sudo killall
python), then restart with "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart".  If the issue
persists, try stopping the server and starting it in two separate
steps, so you see the errors reported by the start script.

Try to log in, and I'm just dumped back to the login screen with no error
=========================================================================

This is usually because IVLE can't save your session information. IVLE saves
sessions to a sessions directory on disk. Unfortunately, this is not currently
configurable in ./setup.py config. You need to edit the Apache config file.

Look for PythonOption mod_python.file_session.database_directory. Make sure it
is set to the place you want. Then, you need to manually make sure that
directory exists.

The default is /var/lib/ivle/sessions.
