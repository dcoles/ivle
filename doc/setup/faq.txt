Install Procedure - Frequently Asked Questions
==============================================

This is a guide for administrators trying to configure IVLE. It answers
questions about common installation mistakes.

Two IVLE headings, and 404 error message "There is no application called 'php'.
===============================================================================

This is an Apache conf problem - you are missing the following section:

    <Directory "/opt/ivle/www/php">
        SetHandler None
    </Directory>

The easiest way is to ensure you copied ivle.conf.

All the CSS and images are missing
==================================

There are a couple of causes of this problem.

1. You could be missing the part of Apache conf which configures the
    "/opt/ivle/www/media" directory. In this case, hyperlinks will be correct.
2. You may have set your "root_dir" setting incorrectly. Make sure it
    corresponds to the URL space where IVLE lives on the web server, or all
    the URLs will be wrong. In this case, hyperlinks will be wrong as well.

IVLE displays a generic Terms of Service notice
===============================================

You should customize the TOS notice at trunk/www/apps/tos/license.html.

Apache Server isn't Restarting
==============================

Make sure no console processes are lying around (e.g. sudo killall
python), then restart with "sudo apache2ctl restart".  If the issue
persists, try stopping the server and starting it in two separate
steps, so you see the errors reported by the start script.
