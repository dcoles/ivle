The **Informatics Virtual Learning Environment** (IVLE) is an open-source web
application for teaching programming and algorithmic problem solving in
Python.

IVLE consists of a web-based IDE featuring:

* Central file management with Subversion workspace browsing
* Browser-based interactive Python console
* Web publishing for students (including Python CGI scripts)
* Program execution in a protected server-side environment
* Online tutorials with automated test cases and assessment
