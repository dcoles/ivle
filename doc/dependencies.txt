List of Dependencies
====================

IVLE requires the following:

* Ubuntu Linux 7.04 or later (see note)
* Python 2.5
* Apache HTTP server
* mod_python
* PostgreSQL

The setup program also requires:

* GCC
* Make

Note: While the developers have made every effort to ensure IVLE is compatible
with all POSIX-compliant operating systems, our setup procedure is currently
tailored to Ubuntu Linux. In particular, it pulls shared libraries out of
known places.

Getting IVLE running on another Unix system would require manually retrieving
all of the packages in this document, as well as changing the setup script to
get the shared library files from the correct places on that system.

At this stage we can only officially recommend Ubuntu 7.04 or later. (Has been
tested on 7.04 and 7.10).

Ubuntu Install Procedure
------------------------

This document merely summarises the required modules. A step-by-step install
procedure for Ubuntu is located in trunk/doc/setup/install_proc.txt.

Python Libraries
----------------

The following python libraries are required to be installed in the main Python
site packages directory:

* [cjson](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/python-cjson)
* [pygresql](http://www.pygresql.org/)
* [pysvn](http://pysvn.tigris.org/)

All of these can be installed by Ubuntu's package management system. See
trunk/doc/setup/install_proc.txt for details.

Additionally, these libraries are installed by the setup script for the
purposes of student code using them:

* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
* [nltk](http://nltk.sourceforge.net)
* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup)
* [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/)
* [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
