List of Dependencies
====================

IVLE requires the following:

* Ubuntu Linux 7.04 or later (see note)
* Python 2.5
* Apache HTTP server
* mod_python
* PostgreSQL

The setup program also requires:

* GCC
* Make
* Debootstrap

Note: While the developers have made every effort to ensure IVLE is compatible
with all POSIX-compliant operating systems, our setup procedure is currently
tailored to Ubuntu Linux. The default install builds a jail based on the Ubuntu 
APT system, but this could be fairly easily modified to work with other APT 
systems which support debootstrap.

Getting IVLE running on another Unix system that doesn't support APT would 
require getting the equivilent packages using the local package system and 
modifying buildjail.sh to bootstrap a new jail.

At this stage we can only officially recommend Ubuntu 8.04 or later.  
(Previously supported 7.04 and 7.10, but the APT repositoryies lack important 
packages which had to be manually installed).

Ubuntu Install Procedure
------------------------

This document merely summarises the required modules. A step-by-step install
procedure for Ubuntu is located in trunk/doc/setup/install_proc.txt.

Python Libraries
----------------

The following python libraries are required to be installed in the main Python
site packages directory:

* [cjson](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/python-cjson)
* [pygresql](http://www.pygresql.org/)
* [pysvn](http://pysvn.tigris.org/)

All of these can be installed by Ubuntu's package management system. See
trunk/doc/setup/install_proc.txt for details.

Additionally, these libraries are installed by the setup script for the
purposes of student code using them:

* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
* [nltk](http://nltk.sourceforge.net)
* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup)
* [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/)
* [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
* [elementtree](http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm) - 1.3 ALPHA
* [simpletal](http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/)
* [scipy](http://www.scipy.org)
