List of Dependencies
====================

IVLE is currently only tested on Ubuntu 8.04+ and Debian 5.0 "lenny".
The supported installation procedure for Ubuntu and Debian can be found in
doc/setup/install_proc.txt.

IVLE requires the following:
 * Python 2.5
 * Apache
 * mod_python
 * PostgreSQL
 * Subversion

Required python modules:
 * pysvn
 * cjson
 * genshi
 * configobj
 * routes
 * docutils
 * epydoc
 * storm
 * psycopg2

The setup process also requires:
 * gcc
 * make

The Debian jail builder requires:
 * debootstrap
 * rsync

Note: While the developers have made every effort to ensure IVLE is compatible
with all POSIX-compliant operating systems, our setup procedure is currently
tailored to Debian and Ubuntu. The default install builds a jail using
debootstrap, which uses apt and dpkg internally.

Getting IVLE running on another UNIX system that doesn't support apt should
simply require a reimplementation of ivle-buildjail to construct a jail of the
appropriate kind.
