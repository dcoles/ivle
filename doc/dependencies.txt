List of Dependencies
====================

IVLE requires the following:

* Linux (similar Unices may work but not guaranteed; we pull out some
    linux-specific libraries into our jail so may need customization,
    particularly of setup.py).

* Python 2.5
* Apache HTTP server
* mod_python

Python Libraries
----------------

The following python libraries are required to be installed in the main Python
site packages directory:

* [cjson](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/python-cjson)
* [web.py](http://webpy.org/)
* [pysvn](http://pysvn.tigris.org/)

Additionally, these libraries are installed by the setup script for the
purposes of student code using them:

* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
