Upgrade Procedure for IVLE
==========================

Upgrading to a new revision of IVLE SVN is generally fairly painless,
but there are several steps involved.

Firstly, in the IVLE checkout, bring your codebase up to date:

  svn update

Then configure and build IVLE. New configuration options may sometimes
be added, so the configuration questions should be watched closely.

  ./setup.py listmake
  ./setup.py config
  ./setup.py build

Note that this will not perform a full rebuild of the template jail -
only the IVLE files inside the jail will be updated. To force a full
jail rebuild, give the build command the -j option.

Now comes the time to block external access to IVLE. Stopping Apache
on each server in the cluster and killing any remaining python-console
processes is highly recommended.

You should then run any outstanding database migrations. A note of the
latest applied migration should probably be kept somewhere to avoid
running the same one twice. This command must be run once for each.

  sudo -u postgres ivle < userdb/migrations/YYYYMMDD-NN.sql

Now we can install the new version:

  ./setup.py install

... and remake the user jails, as this will occasionally be needed:

  ./remakeuser.py --all --verbose

Restart the usrmgt-server and all Apaches, reenable external access,
check that everything works, and you're done!
