<p>The IVLE <strong>File Browser</strong> is your way to access and edit your 
files stored in IVLE</p>
<h2>Getting Started with File Browser</h2>
<h3>Navigating</h3>
<p>The Filebrowser works very much like most other file browsers. When you open 
the file browser you will be faced with a series of icons representing the 
directories (the 'folder' icon) and files (the 'paper' icons) in your home 
directory.  Clicking on the name of a directory will open the directory while 
clicking the line or icon of a directory or file will mearly select it.  
Multiple directories or files may be selected by clicking the checkbox in the 
far left column. You can also browse up to a higher level directory by clicking 
the required folder in the breadcrumb trail near the top of the window.</p>
<h3>Adding Directories or Files</h3>
<p>To create a new directory or file, open the <strong>More actions...</strong> 
drop down box and select either <strong>New Directory</strong> or <strong>New 
File</strong> under Directory actions.  A pop up box will appear asking for the 
name of the new file. Enter the name and the file will appear in the current 
directory. Another way is by <a href="#uploadingFiles">Uploading Files</a> from 
your local computer.</p>
<h3>Editing Files</h3>
<p>To edit a file in the text editor, click the name of the file you wish to 
edit in the file browser and then click <strong>Open</strong>. This will then open 
the file in the Text Editor screen. When finished editing the selected file 
click <strong>Save</strong> button to save the file to IVLE.</p>
<h3>Deleting Directories or Files</h3>
<p>To delete a directory or file, open the <strong>More actions...</strong> drop 
down box and click <strong>Delete</strong> under File actions. A pop-up window will 
appear to confirm that you really wish to delete the file.</p>
