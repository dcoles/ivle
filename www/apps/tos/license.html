<p><b>*** SAMPLE ONLY ***</b></p>
<p>This is the text of the IVLE Terms of Service.</p>
<p>The administrator should replace this license file with an appropriate
"Terms of Service" license for your organisation.</p>
<h2>Instructions for Administrators</h2>
<p>Replace the file <b><tt>trunk/www/apps/tos/license.html</tt></b> with an
HTML file with the appropriately-worded license.</p>
<p>This should be a normal XHTML file, except it should not contain
<tt>html</tt>, <tt>head</tt> or <tt>body</tt> elements - it should
just be the contents of a body element (IVLE will wrap it accordingly).</p>
<p>This file is provided as an example.</p>
