These files are several examples that may be run by the test framework.

------------------
all_input_text.xml
all_input.py
------------------
An xml spec for a problem which requires reading various input sources and a possible attempt at the problem.

------------------
fib_text.xml
fib.py
------------------
An xml spec for a problem which requires writing a function to calculate fibonnaci numbers, and a slightly incorrect implementation.

--------
tests.py
--------
A python script which runs the all_input and fib examples through the test framework.

---------
hack_1.py
---------
An example script that can be used to pass any test case which tests the output of a script (not functoins).

-----------------
filespace_test.py
file_test.py
-----------------
filespace_test contains a script which to test the TestFilespace class. It does this by executing file_test, which performs various file operations inside the class.

Currently, the output is verified by inspection. I found the idle implementation of various modes is not comppletely robust, making proper verification harder. Probably the best is to actually write a C program and use fopen.
