<h2>Submitting a project</h2>
<p>IVLE submissions are made through the File Browser. Before making a
submission, you must perform the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the project is in the correct directory. If it is a solo
project, it should be in the "mywork" directory of the correct subject. If it
is a group project, it should be in the supplied group directory.</li>
<li>Use the Subversion actions to <strong>add</strong> and
<strong>commit</strong> all of the files to be submitted. Files which are not
committed (displaying a green tick) will <em>not be submitted</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p><a class="helpaction" href="/+help/Files/Subversion">Help using
Subversion</a></p>

<p>To submit to a project that has not yet closed, use the file browser to
navigate to the file or directory that you wish to submit, click "More
actions...", "Submit", and then select the correct project.</p>

<p>If the project to which you intend to submit is not listed, ensure that you
are in the correct directory, or a subdirectory thereof. For solo projects,
you must be inside the subject's "mywork" directory. For group projects, you
must be inside the directory for the assigned group.</p>

<p>You may resubmit a project again at any time until its deadline, but a new
submission will overwrite any made earlier.</p>

<h2>Verifying the submission</h2>

<p>It is important to verify each submission after you make it. This ensures
that the correct files were submitted, and that they contain the right
contents.</p>

<p>You can verify any submission by going to the subject page and clicking the
<strong>verify</strong> link. This takes you to a special file view which
displays the files as they were submitted.</p>
