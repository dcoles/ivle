<p>A key part of the IVLE worksheets are the programming exercises. You will 
find several of them interspersed
amongst the text of a typical worksheet.</p>
<!-- The exercises come in three levels of difficulty: basic,  -->
<!-- intermediate and advanced.  -->
<p>To complete a worksheet you must solve all of exercises that it contains.</p>
<!-- The advanced exercises will require more time and thought, and you are encouraged to try them if you yearn for a challenge. -->
<p>Normally each exercise will require you to write a piece of code, and submit it for verification.
Your submitted code will be automatically tested by IVLE against a number of different inputs. You will
get feedback from IVLE about which test cases your solution passed, and which ones (if any) it failed. 
To complete the exercise you must pass all the test cases.</p>

<p>If you want to check how your code behaves before submitting it, click on the button
labelled <strong>Run</strong>, at the bottom right hand corner below the exercise box. 
The result of Run will be displayed in the console window.
When you believe your solution is ready
for submission, click on the button labelled <strong>Submit</strong>, next to the Run button.  
You can submit as many attempts as you like for a particular problem.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The IVLE system keeps a record of each submission you make,
including which test cases were passed or failed.
This information is aggregated and made available to teaching
staff and curriculum developers so they can monitor student
progress and improve the quality of the worksheets.</p>

<p>The test cases can be <strong>very</strong> picky about small details, things that we humans tend to
overlook. Therefore you should pay close attention to the requirements of the exercise, and watch out for
things such as:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Capitalisation of letters.</li>
<li>The format of the output. In particular the amount and location of whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks).</li>
<li>Punctuation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally there are several test cases for each exercise. The first tests are usually the simplest and the most lenient
in terms of correctness. Later tests become more challenging and stringent. When you fail a test case you will
see a short message about the kind of thing your program did not do properly. This should give you some idea about
what needs to be fixed in order to pass the test, although sometimes it might take a bit of thinking before
you can resolve the problem. Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>
