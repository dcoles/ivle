===============================

Description
-----------

This is a prototype for a home-grown Ajax-based web file browser and text
editor with Subversion client support.

The backend (files.py) is written in Python, and accepts commands, performing
actions and returning JSON data for the client.

The client consists of 2 plain HTML files (browser.html, edit.html) and a
JavaScript file (browser.js), which interact with the server solely through
Ajax.

Usage
-----

The client side has no setup required. Should run immediately in any "good"
browser :)

The server side requires Apache, mod_python, and a setup with the publisher
handler. Make sure files.py is run with the publisher handler.

You also need to edit files.py and change the global variable "root" to point
to the place you want the browser to browse (or it will die silently).

Files
-----

* files.py: Python backend. Written for Publisher handler. See files.readme.
* browser.html, edit.html: Plain HTML files which import JavaScript files.
* browser.js: Client-side JavaScript file.

Third-party files:

* encoder.py: from the simplejson package (v1.7.3). It comes as a big
  package but I just used this one file. License: MIT License.
* json2.js: from www.json.org. JavaScript JSON library.
