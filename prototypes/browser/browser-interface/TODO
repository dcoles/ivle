IVLE Browser Interface - TODO
=============================

* Status bar all the way to the bottom even if the page is smaller than
    screen height.
* Fix double-border between file table and status bar (if file table is taller
    than side panel).
* Find a way to limit the height of filetablediv to exactly fill the canvas.
    (Currently expands arbitrarily, so its scrollbars never show. It has
    overflow: auto so it will show scrollbars if its height is constrained).
* The entire layout should exactly fill the canvas. The side panel should be
    set to overflow as well, so the canvas scrollbars never show, only the
    internal ones.
